# Weather App

## Overview

This is a 5-day forecast weather app created with Flask that allows users to enter a city and view the current weather in Fahrenheit for the entire week as well as additional details describing the forecast. The app fetches weather data from an API and displays it on a web page. I currently am working on using Heroku to make this app accessible through a simple public link.
